Semantic Kernel is an open-source SDK developed by Microsoft that enables developers 
to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT or Azure OpenAI into their C# applications. 
It provides a powerful abstraction layer that combines traditional programming with AI capabilities, 
allowing developers to define and orchestrate "semantic functions"—natural language prompts 
that can be treated like regular code functions. These functions can be composed, chained, 
and combined with native C# code, making it easier to build intelligent applications that understand and generate human-like text.
In C#, Semantic Kernel supports features like memory storage, planning, and function chaining, 
which are essential for building context-aware and goal-driven applications. Developers can use it to create chatbots, 
summarization tools, or even autonomous agents that can reason and act based on user input. 
The SDK is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing seamless integration 
with external services and custom plugins. With Semantic Kernel, 
C# developers can harness the power of AI while maintaining the structure and reliability 
of traditional software engineering.
